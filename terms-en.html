      <p>13.1 If product descriptions, images, videos, etc. of Target Products are posted on the Service, the Operator does not guarantee their truthfulness or accuracy. Complaints or inquiries regarding Target Products sold by third parties should be directed to the manufacturer or seller, not to the Operator.</p>
