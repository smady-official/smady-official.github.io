        Paid features (subscriptions) in the Service are provided through App Store billing such as Apple App Store / Google Play. The Operator does not directly obtain payment information such as credit card numbers.

      </p>

      <h3>2-4. Information Provided When You Contact Us</h3>
      <p>If you contact us, we may collect your name (optional), email address, inquiry details, etc. to the extent necessary to respond.</p>

      <h2 id="p4">4. Purposes of Use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>To provide and operate the Service</li>
        <li>To improve quality and features, analyze incidents, and prevent fraud</li>
        <li>To respond to inquiries (including identity verification where necessary)</li>
        <li>To display and deliver ads, measure effectiveness, control frequency, and prevent fraud (mainly for free users)</li>
        <li>To provide subscriptions, confirm purchase status, and provide/control paid features</li>
        <li>To respond to violations of the Terms of Use, etc.</li>
        <li>For purposes incidental to the above</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="p5">5. Use of External Services (SDKs, etc.) / Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        The Operator may use the following external services (including SDKs) to provide and operate the Service. In connection with such use, information may be transmitted to external service providers to the extent necessary. How external service providers handle information is governed by their respective privacy policies, etc.
      </p>
      <ul>

      <h2 id="p6">6. Advertising (Free Users)</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may display advertisements to free users. Advertising may be stopped or reduced for users who subscribe (or otherwise qualify) according to plans designated by the Operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can restrict use of advertising identifiers, disable personalized ads (or limit tracking), etc. via your Device/OS settings. Settings methods follow your Device/OS.
      </p>

      <h2 id="p7">7. On-Device Processing (Videos, etc.)</h2>
      <p>
        In principle, analyses of videos, etc. in the Service are performed within your Device, and the Operator does not upload and store your video files on servers.
        However, this may change if you share to external services by operation, or if handling changes due to future feature additions.
      </p>

      <p>*If you do not grant permissions, some or all features may be unavailable.</p>

      <h2 id="p9">9. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>The Operator will take necessary and appropriate measures to prevent leakage, loss, or damage of collected information and to ensure secure management. (Details of such measures will be provided individually within a reasonable scope in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.)</p>

      <h2 id="p10">10. Retention Period</h2>

      <h2 id="p11">11. Disclosure / Correction / Suspension of Use / Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with applicable laws, you may request disclosure, correction, suspension of use, deletion, etc. of information about yourself that the Operator holds.
        However, because the Service does not require account registration, the information held by the Operator may be limited, and the scope of possible responses may also be limited. If you have a request, please contact us via “13. Contact for Inquiries.”
